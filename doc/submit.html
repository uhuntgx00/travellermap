<h1>Submitting Data To The Traveller Map</h1>
<div class="content">

  <div>
    <p>
      Thanks to the long history of attempts to flesh out Charted
      Space, by individuals who often went on to become authors, and
      groups such as HIWG, unofficial data is welcomed as a source of
      enjoyment for all players of <cite>Traveller</cite> and
      included in the map.
    </p>

    <h3>Submission Type #1: "Faraway" Sectors</h3>
    <p>
      Sectors not intended to be related to the OTU, designed for your
      <cite>Traveller</cite> campaigns or simply the enjoyment of
      other players, may be hosted on the Traveller Map. These sectors
      will be listed as <i>Unofficial</i>, and be placed in locations
      far from Charted Space. You may view these as distant "islands"
      in the vast seas of the Milky Way galaxy - perhaps on the far
      side of a wormhole, or where misjumps lead - but this is really
      just a convenient partitioning scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are few, if any, restrictions placed on "faraway" sectors.
      They may be home to unofficial major races, show evidence of
      stellar engineering, and so forth.  As an example, sectors
      published by the Judges Guild were "approved for use with
      Traveller" but are no longer considered official. These are
      presented as "faraway" sectors on the map, far from charted
      space:

      Guild Sectors</a>.

    <h3>Submission Type #2: OTU Additions</h3>
    <p>
      Sectors intended to "fill in the blanks" of the OTU, places where
      the T5SS has not yet approved data, are welcome submissions to the
      Traveller Map.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a minimum, such sectors should match adjacent
      sectors. Specifically, stellar densities, polities, populations,
      starports, tech levels and routes should blend smoothly with
      adjoining sectors. And since there are no other major races in
      the OTU, beyond the core of Charted Space there will rarely be
      large empires. The farther from Core sector you go, the more
      primitive the region.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unofficial data may be replaced at any time.
      <li>
        If you wish any elements of your submission to be considered
        for inclusion in the official T5SS data, ensure that your contact
        information is given and updated.
    </ul>
